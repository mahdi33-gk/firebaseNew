## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 **Firebase Authentication**  
  - Register and log in with ease.  
  - Secure route protection to keep user data safe.

- 🎨 **Custom DaisyUI + Tailwind Navbar**  
  - Responsive across all devices.  
  - Styled and structured with love 💅.

- 🧭 **React Router Navigation**  
  - Smooth routing experience.  
  - Conditionally rendered routes for logged-in users.

- 🔐 **Protected Route: `/order`**  
  - Only visible to logged-in users!  
  - If someone tries to type `/order` directly—Boom! They're redirected to the login page 😎

- 👤 **Profile Section**  
  - Just like `/order`, the **Profile** appears only when a user is logged in.  
  - It's built into the navbar, clean and dynamic.
